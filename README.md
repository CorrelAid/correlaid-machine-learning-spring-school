# CorrelAid Machine Learning Winter School

Welcome to the CorrelAid ML Winter School!

## Task

The problem we want to solve is to classify a mushroom either as eatable or poisonous. 

## Data

The data to be analyzed is one of the classic data sets from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php), the [Mushroom Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom).

It's a multivariate data set with 22 attributes and 8124 observations, donated in the year 1987. Mushroom records are drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). G. H. Lincoff (Pres.), New York: Alfred A. Knopf 

This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family (pp. 500-525). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like ``leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

**Note**: We provide the data set as it can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification) and not in its original form from the UCI repository.
