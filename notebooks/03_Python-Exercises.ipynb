    "For learning loops, if-statements and functions, the Sieve of Eratosthenes and the bubble sort are classic tasks. Look at the explanations and the pseudo code on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort and try an implementation in Python for both. For this, write the two functions `bubblesort` and `sieve`. Test the sieve of Eratosthenes on the numbers 1 to 100 and the bubble sort on the vector (17, 42, 4, 99, 8, 16).\n",
